  Welcome to EBNF 2 Railroad
  ==========================

  In this editor you can try out the command line tool.

  Comments will be rendered throught markdown,
  so you can do **markup** in them.

  `Ctrl-Shift-C`/`Cmd-Shift-C` will expand the selected
  string in `terminal` elements for each character,
  as a choice element.

  ```
  digit = 1234567890;
  ```

  selecting the numbers and pressing `Ctrl-Shift-C` /
  `Cmd-Shift-C`

  will expand this into:

  ```
  digit = "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" | "0";
  ```

  The EBNF syntax is as follows:

*)



grammar = { rule } ;
rule = lhs , "=" , rhs , ";" ;

lhs = identifier ;
rhs = identifier
     | terminal
     | "[" , rhs , "]"
     | "{" , rhs , "}"
     | "(" , rhs , ")"
     | rhs , "|" , rhs
     | rhs , "," , rhs ;

identifier = letter , { letter | digit | "_" } ;
terminal = "'" , character , { character } , "'"
         | '"' , character , { character } , '"' ;

character = letter | digit | symbol | "_" ;

  These are low level components, the small building blocks.

letter = "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F" | "G"
       | "H" | "I" | "J" | "K" | "L" | "M" | "N"
       | "O" | "P" | "Q" | "R" | "S" | "T" | "U"
       | "V" | "W" | "X" | "Y" | "Z" | "a" | "b"
       | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f" | "g" | "h" | "i"
       | "j" | "k" | "l" | "m" | "n" | "o" | "p"
       | "q" | "r" | "s" | "t" | "u" | "v" | "w"
       | "x" | "y" | "z" ;

digit = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" ;

symbol = "[" | "]" | "{" | "}" | "(" | ")" | "<" | ">"
       | "'" | '"' | "=" | "|" | "." | "," | ";" ;
