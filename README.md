# Transparency Information Language and Toolkit

With this proposed schema for transparency information with regards to data privacy, an essential step towards a sophisticated ecosystem shall be made by introducing a transparency enhancing toolkit based on a formal language model describing transparency information in the context of multi-service environments and latest legal requirements (EU General Data Protection Regulation). The desired results of the work should be suitable as ready-to-use privacy engineering solutions for developers and serve as a starting point for further research in this area. Eventually, data subjects should (be able to) understand what happens to data relating to them by using the interfaces of the toolkit.
